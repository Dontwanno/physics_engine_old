# To Do list

- [ ] extract the checking of file existance and creation of new actor into a function
- [ ] link model.h to class to actor.userData for rendering the convexMesh or triangleMesh
- [ ] add a function to create a new actor with a given model
- [ ] learn about VAO, VBO and EBO storage. Is it necessary to store all for performance?
- [x] implement the createTriangleMesh function (same way as  convex mesh)
- [ ] create URDF parser to PxRigidDynamic function
- [ ] implement forward/ deferred/ combined rendering
- [ ] apply sobel filter to depth buffer
- [ ] apply sobel filter to normal map
- [ ] add noise to uv sampling of filtered normal map
- [ ] Add V-hacd to check if convex decomposition can be done better
